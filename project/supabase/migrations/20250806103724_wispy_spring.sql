  # Disable RLS for Cart Tables

  This migration simplifies the cart system by removing Row Level Security policies
  that were causing authentication issues.

  ## Changes Made
  1. Disable RLS on cart_sessions table
  2. Disable RLS on cart_items table
  3. Drop all existing policies on these tables

  ## Security Note
  This removes security restrictions on cart tables for simplified access.
  In production, consider implementing proper RLS policies based on your security requirements.
